<h4>What is OpenMandriva?</h4>
<p>OpenMandriva Association was established on December 12, 2012 under 1901 French law. It manages some Free software projects, including OpenMandriva Lx - a GNU/Linux operating system - that is a free alternative to the wide world known Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS.</p>
<p>OpenMandriva is also the name of a worldwide community of people who are passionate about free software and want to lead in the creation and spreading of free code and content by working together as a community.</p>
<h4>Why OpenMandriva?</h4>
<p>We are a 100% community-driven association that believes in the values of free software and collaboration. We fight to protect these values and promote solutions anyone can use, change and distribute. OpenMandriva believes in creating, improving, promoting and distributing free software in general, and its projects in particular. We also crave for promoting free exchange of knowledge and equality of opportunity in software access and development, as well as in education, science and research. Our products are developed with passion by the community and aim to be flexible in use by all.</p>
<p>OpenMandriva represents the paradigm: from community to community, with passion, fun and dedication.</p>
<h4>OpenMandriva Values</h4>
<p>The founding values of OpenMandriva are development, equality, co-operation, openness, freedom, group achievement, independence, and solidarity.</p>
<p>These values reflect what we believe in and are the main identity of our community. They represent open development of software, equality between all the community members - from simple users to programmers to patrons - cooperation and solidarity between all. We all as a community will achieve our objectives and help to build products that are good for all.</p>
